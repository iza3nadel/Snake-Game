# Snake-Game
A classic Snake Game built in Python using the turtle graphics module. The player controls a snake that grows each time it eats food - the goal is to achieve the highest possible score without hitting the walls or the snake’s own body.

Features:

- Smooth snake movement using the arrow keys

- Randomly generated food positions

- Persistent high score saved to a file (data.txt)

- Automatic game reset on collision
